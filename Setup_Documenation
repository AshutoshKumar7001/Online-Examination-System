To create a Django project from scratch using the "Online Examination System" repository you provided, follow these steps:


1. **Clone the Repository**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the Django project. Then, use the following command to clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AshutoshKumar7001/Online-Examination-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the root directory of the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd onlinexamination/
   ```

3. **Update pip (Optional but recommended)**: Before installing dependencies, it's a good practice to ensure that pip is up-to-date. Run the following command to upgrade pip:
   ```
   python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

4. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for your Django project. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv":
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the project dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Set Up Database**: Configure your database settings in the `settings.py` file located in the `online_exam` directory. You may need to adjust settings such as database name, user, password, host, and port according to your environment.
   Once configured, apply the initial migrations to create the database schema:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

7. **Create a Superuser (Optional)**: If you need to access the Django admin interface, create a superuser account using the following command and follow the prompts:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Run the Development Server**: Start the Django development server to run your project locally:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view your Django project. You can access the admin interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` if you created a superuser.

This addition ensures that users have the latest version of pip installed before proceeding with dependency installation, which can help mitigate potential issues related to outdated pip versions.
